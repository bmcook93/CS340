CS 340: Client/Server Development



    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Programs should be carefully thought out and implemented in a modular way. Functions should not be overly specific, so that programs can be adapted for other projects. Clean, well commented code is essential. The CRUD module I developed in Project One was adaptable for every assignment that followed it throughout the CS-340 course. I could easily implement it into any other project where I need a program that can read and write data from and to a database.
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
Approaching problems as a computer scientist requires breaking down problems into small chunks and performing incremental work. For all future assignments, my strategy will be to think about how I could create a program in a way that can be utilized for other projects.
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists find ways to automate solutions to problems. Grazioso Salvare needed a program that would automatically sort through different types of rescue animals from a given database; programming modules that accomplish this allows the company to focus on their own specific needs with those rescue animals, rather than how to find them.
